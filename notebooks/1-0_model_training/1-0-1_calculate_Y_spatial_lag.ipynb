    "A common issue when training models on geospatial data is the problem of spatial autocorrelation. If the labels for your data are spatially autocorrelated, then traditional cross-validation (CV) approaches such as randomized K-Fold CV may indicate overly-optimistic model performance. This is because, when points are randomly selected for fold assignment, it is very likely that some points that are spatially correlated with each other may be assigned to different folds. As a result, spatially correlated (i.e. dependently similar) may exist in both the train and the test folds, confounding the generalizability assessement of the model (see [Meyer and Pebesma, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29838-9) and [Kattenborn *et al*., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667393222000072)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, we can use **Spatial K-Fold cross-validation** (SKCV) ([Pohjankukka *et al*., 2017](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14263)). SKCV first requires one to calculate the spatial lag, or spatial autocorrelation range of the response variable. Next, we create a hex grid with side length equal to that range, and then bin the data by the hex cells. Finally, we assign fold IDs to *entire hex cells* instead of to individual points. This, in turn, gives us confidence that we are never testing a model against data that may be spatially correlated to its training data."

    "Since we just featurized the EO data together with the combined sPlot and GBIF data, we can simply load the newly generated features and fit a variogram model to the data. We don't know by default which type of variogram is best, however (e.g. isotropic vs. anisotropic). To determine this, we can fit both types of models (one assuming directional independence and another directional dependence), calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of both models, and then we can use the range of the model with the lowest AIC.\n",
